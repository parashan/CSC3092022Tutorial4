Working with the VM(Download, ssh, scp)

SSH
`ssh csc309@192.168.58.128`

password = pass (Note you can setup ssh keys https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2 if you want to)

Copy directory to remote
`scp -r csc309@192.168.58.128:{path in remote} {path to local file} `

Copy directory to remote
`scp -r {path to local file} csc309@192.168.58.128:{path in remote}`

Even better, use VSCode Remote SSH/Equivalent extension/feature of your IDEs to remotely mount the file


Downloading virtualenv(already installed on the vm), downloading Django on virtualenv

Requires python, pip

`pip install virtualenv`

`virtualenv {envname}`

`source {envname}/bin/activate` (make sure you are currently at the same directory that you ran virtualenv in)

`pip install django`
Windows specific issues

You might not be able to call `virtualenv {envname}` directly, instead use `python3 -m virtualenv {envname}`
